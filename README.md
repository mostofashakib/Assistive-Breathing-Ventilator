# Assistive-Breathing-Ventilator

This is an implementation of a mechanical ventilator using bicycle pumps, a rack & pinion system attached to a pressure sensor and airflow sensor for ECE 3331 - Project Lab 1. The ventilator is controlled by an Arduino Mega board and is coded in C++ to make a low cost DIY Ventilator.
